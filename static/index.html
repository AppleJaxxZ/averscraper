          <h3>Getting Started</h3>
          <p>
            If you are here, it's because you have to get drug screened from
            AverHealth and have been given a pin number that you use to check to
            see if you are scheduled. How this app works is it takes your pin
            number and date of birth and checks the AverHealth website to see if
            you have a urine test. The difference between this app and the
            website is that this app automatically runs once a day for you
            without having to continuously enter in your login information. As a
            bonus, this app also runs in the Background of your device and sends
            you an notification if you are scheduled for a urine screen. As a
            double bonus, Im also setting up text message alerts as well. This
            app is intended to be a tool, a layer of protection, and is in no
            way a fail-safe. This app is in it's infancy and may be prone to
            errors, bugs, and shutdowns while the first year of testing is
            happening.

              time.
