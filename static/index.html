          <h3>Getting Started</h3>
          <p>
            If you are here, it's because you have to get urines from
            AverHealth. As you know, AverHealth requires us to call in everyday
            to see if your personal pin number is schedule, meaning..you have a
            test today. What this app does, is takes the hassle out of calling
            everyday, and lets the client enter in their PIN and Date Of Birth,
            into the system which is then stored locally on your device and
            reused to check if you are scheduled for a test today. The test runs
            every night at 9:30pm so you can know the night before the day of
            your test if you are being scheduled.
